# Chat Assignement


A program that implements arduino-to-arduino communication over a serial link that is encrypted using the Diffie-Hellman shared secret protocol to establish a shared key.

The following concepts were also implemented:
1) Modular arithmetic
2) Bit operations
3) The notion of a time-efficient algorithm
4) Using random numbers
5) Byte-based serial communication between programs
6) ASCII character encodings
7) Reading character input and converting it into numbers
